## About Me !


#### I am currently an undergraduate student at IIIT-Allahabad pursuing B.Tech. in Information Technology.


 I am a person for whom learning new things is a bliss. I am currently excelling myself in App development and Competitive Programming. In free time, I like to write on various platforms on the internet like Quora. I also have developed an educational youtube channel to help the student community. I love to find out reason why a particular thing is happening. I also like to go through various articles/blogs about technology, politics & business on the internet. I love playing badminton. In the past, I have participated and held positions as a representative in the student community. My dream is to make a world where peace and harmony prevails.
